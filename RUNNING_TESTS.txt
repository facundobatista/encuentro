How to run the tests in the project
===================================

Read this if you're a developer of the project and want to know how
to run the tests.


If you still didn't downloaded the code
---------------------------------------

Just branch it and get there:

  bzr branch lp:encuentro new-branch-name
  cd new-branch-name


Dependencies
------------

We're in a mixed state of Py2 and Py3 right now, and virtualenv is not
good for this, so or you install the dependencies in your system, or
just use two virtualenvs.

Of course, you'll need Python3.

Then, a bunch of dependencies automatically handled by pip:

  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Again, do that with sudo in all your system, or separatedly in different
virtualenvs.

Finally, flake8 and pylint are needed for static code analysis.


Running the tests
-----------------

If you have all installed in the system, just do:

  ./test

Otherwise just execute all what it does, but separately in different environments.


Note: In Ubuntu Trusty using nosetests3 failed to me when having it
configured with with-progressive option, this fixed that:
